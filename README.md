- credit score

## Technologies

Describe the technologies required to use your project such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the specific versions of any critical dependencies that you have used in the stable version of your project.

- python 3.2 or later
- python libraries and modules: fire, questionary, csv, pathlib (details below)
- csv file (comma separated values) 
- jupyter notebook and VS code
- git bash terminal on Windows 10 OS

python libraries:
- questionary: facilitates dialog and prompt features, creating a more interactive experience for users.
- fire: automatically generates a command line interface from any python object with a call function.
- csv: simple file format "comma separated values", uses commas as delimiters to parse bank and borrower data.
- pathlib: normalizes file path nuances between various operating systems, making the app usable on most PCs.
